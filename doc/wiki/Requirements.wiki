WWB currently requires:

   * Maven 2.0 is required to build. A binary WAR file (wicketwebbeans-examples.war) containing all of the dependent jars is available. 
   * Wicket 1.3.0-rc1 (http://wicket.apache.org) - dependency managed by Maven. Apache Wicket 1.2.6 is also supported in a separate branch.
   * Apache Commons !BeanUtils (via Maven http://maven.apache.org)
   * Java 5+. WWB has been developed and tested mostly with Java 6.
