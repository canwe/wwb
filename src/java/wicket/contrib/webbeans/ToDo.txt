- Bug: Test null list on BeanListEditor
- Bug: IE: table row hover highlighting not working.
- Bug: Collapsibles should be built out of wicket components. Doesn't remember state on refresh

- Option to find components of properties. Have this already?

-----
- context parameter for sub-bean references.
- @NULLABLE/not for required fields. (@NOTNULLABLE)
- props could be a list of property *expressions*  to be included
- Each row in a table is a bean, but you should be able to control whether the individual row is view-only via a property
	expression.
- Hide BeanListEditor navbar if everything fits on one page.
- Remove dependency on bean utils?
- Handle array types where List types are used. Worked on this, but probably need a model wrapper 
  the fully wraps an array in a pass-thru List (Arrays.asList() doesn't clear or add).
- Date picker icon should be div that's style-able so that calendar icon can be skinned. Or have a parameter.
- bean/property name should be additional class on editors/viewers so that per-property can be configured.
  Alternately can use wicket id (long). Need to output markup id in this case.
- movable/resizable table columns
- rowspan support in table?
- Support JavaBean Constrained flag for vetoable types?
- Tree/table for nested tables
